# This is a sample YAML file for fault injection configuration
# The fields here should correspond to the Fields in fiConfig.py

# Deterministic fault seed for the injections
# Seed: 1000

# Type of fault to be injected for Scalars and Tensors
# Allowed values are {None, Rand, Zero, Rand-element, bitFlip-element, bitFlip-tensor, binaryBitFlip, sequentialBitFlip}

ScalarFaultType: None
#TensorFaultType: None
TensorFaultType: bitFlip-element


# Add the list of Operations and their probabilities here
# Each entry must be in a separate line ad start with a '-'
# each line must represent an OP and it's probability value
# See fiConfig.py for a full list of allowed OP values
# NOTE: These should not be any tabs anywhere below

Ops:
 - CONV2D = 1.0 # Chooses all operations
 - ADD = 1.0
 - RELU = 1.0
 - MAX-POOL = 1.
 - RESHAPE = 1.
 - MATMUL = 1.
 
#  - LRN = 1.0
# - EQUAL = 1.0
#  - SOFT-MAX = 1.0
# - DIV = 0.0 # This does not exist - and should be ignored (Test)
# - SUB = -0.5 # This should raise an exception

# How many times the set of above operations should be skipped before injection
# SkipCount: 1

Instances:
#  - ADD = 3
#  - MATMUL = 1
#  - ABSOLUTE = 1
#  - NEGATIVE = 1
#  - SUM = 1
#  - ARGMIN = 1

  - CONV2D = 8
  - MAX-POOL = 4
  - RELU = 10

  - MATMUL = 3 



# There are three inject mode:
# There are 3 ways to determine HOW to select an operation for injection"
# 1) Using error rate to determine the probability of each opertaor to be injected " 
# 2) Profiling the instance of each operation so that each operation will be injected for ONCE only" 
# 3) Perform random injection over one op per run". In this mode, the 'ALL' variable in the Ops section must be claimed explicitly. 
# In the second and third mode, you'll need to specify the instances of all the operators in the algorithm

# Allowed values: 1) "errorRate"; 2) "dynamicInstance"; 3) "oneFaultPerRun" 
InjectMode: "oneFaultPerRun"
#InjectMode: "dynamicInstance"
