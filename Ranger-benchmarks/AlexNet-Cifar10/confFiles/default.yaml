# This is a sample YAML file for fault injection configuration
# The fields here should correspond to the Fields in fiConfig.py

# Deterministic fault seed for the injections
# Seed: 1000

# Type of fault to be injected for Scalars and Tensors
# Allowed values are {None, Rand, Zero, Rand-element, bitFlip-element, bitFlip-tensor, binaryBitFlip, sequentialBitFlip}

ScalarFaultType: None
TensorFaultType: bitFlip-element
#TensorFaultType: None

# Add the list of Operations and their probabilities here
# Each entry must be in a separate line ad start with a '-'
# each line must represent an OP and it's probability value
# See fiConfig.py for a full list of allowed OP values
# NOTE: These should not be any tabs anywhere below

Ops: 

- ALL = 1.0
#- CONV2D = 1.0
#- RELU = 1.0
#- BIASADD = 1.0
#- RESHAPE = 1.0
#- MATMUL = 1.0

 
# How many times the set of above operations should be skipped before injection
# SkipCount: 1

Instances:

  - MAX-POOL = 3
  - CONV2D = 5 
  - RELU = 6
  - BIASADD = 7
  - RESHAPE = 2 
  - MATMUL = 2 



# There are three inject mode:
# There are 3 ways to determine HOW to select an operation for injection"
# 1) Using error rate to determine the probability of each opertaor to be injected " 
# 2) Profiling the instance of each operation so that each operation will be injected for ONCE only" 
# 3) Perform random injection over one op per run". In this mode, the 'ALL' variable in the Ops section must be claimed explicitly. 
# In the second and third mode, you'll need to specify the instances of all the operators in the algorithm

# Allowed values: 1) "errorRate"; 2) "dynamicInstance"; 3) "oneFaultPerRun" 
#InjectMode: "dynamicInstance"
InjectMode: "oneFaultPerRun"
